  #### A fictitious sample dataset
  For discussion, I'll use a fictional example dataset that I'm using to work through some statistical theory related to Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
  In the motivating example use case we are interested in predicting the civil status (married, single, divorced/widowed) of individuals from their sex (male, female) and sector of activity (primary, secondary, tertiary). The data set is composed of 273 cases.
  
  The data (and related statistical theory) come from:
  
  - Ritschard, G. (2006). Computing and using the deviance with classification trees. In Compstat 2006 - Proceedings in Computational Statistics 17th Symposium Held in Rome, Italy, 2006. Retrieved from [This Link](http://mephisto.unige.ch/pub/publications/gr/ritschard_compstat06.pdf)
  
  - Ritschard, G., Pisetta, V., & Zighed, D. (2008). Inducing and evaluating classification trees with statistical implicative criteria. Statistical Implicative Analysis. Studies in Computational Intelligence Volume 127, pp 397-419. Retrieved from [This Link](http://mephisto.unige.ch/pub/publications/gr/ritsch-pisetta-zighed_bookGras_rev.pdf)
  
  #### Code:
      # copy and paste the data from the PDF (Table 1 in both papers)
      civst_gend_sector  <- read.csv(textConnection(
          "civil_status gender activity_sector number_of_cases
               married   male         primary              50
               married   male       secondary              40
               married   male        tertiary               6
               married female         primary               0
               married female       secondary              14
               married female        tertiary              10
                single   male         primary               5
                single   male       secondary               5
                single   male        tertiary              12
                single female         primary              50
                single female       secondary              30
                single female        tertiary              18
      divorced/widowed   male         primary               5
      divorced/widowed   male       secondary               8
      divorced/widowed   male        tertiary              10
      divorced/widowed female         primary               6
      divorced/widowed female       secondary               2
      divorced/widowed female        tertiary               2
      "),sep = "")
  
      # save this to my personal R utilities package "disentangle" 
      # for use later when I am exploring functions
      dir.create("inst/extdata", recursive=T)
      write.csv(civst_gend_sector, "inst/extdata/civst_gend_sector.csv", row.names = F)
  
  <p></p>
  
  That is fine and good, we can use the case weights option to include number of cases but sometimes we want to use one row per person.
  In the next chunk of code I;ll reformat the data, and also add another fictitious variable called income and contrive an example where a certain group earns less based on their activity sector.
  
  #### Code:
      df <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 0, ncol = 3))
      for(i in 1:nrow(civst_gend_sector))
          {
          #    i <- 1
              n <- civst_gend_sector$number_of_cases[i]
              if(n == 0) next
              for(j in 1:n)
                  {
                    df <- rbind(df, civst_gend_sector[i,1:3])              
                  }
       
          }
  
      df$income  <- rnorm(nrow(df), 1000,200)
      # Let us say secondary men earn less
      df$income[df$gender == "male" & df$activity == "secondary"]  <- df$income[df$gender == "male" & df$activity == "secondary"] - 500
      str(df)
      # save this for use later
      write.csv(df, "inst/extdata/civst_gend_sector_full.csv", row.names = F)
  
  #### Motivating reason for using these data
  Classification and Regression Tree models (also referred to as Decision Trees) are one of the building blocks of data mining and a great tool for Exploratory Data Analysis.
  
  I've mostly used Regression Trees in the past but recently got some work with social science data where Classification Trees were needed.  I wanted to assess the deviance as well as the misclassification error rate for measuring the descriptive power of the tree.  While this is a easy with Regression Trees it became obvious that it was not so easy with Classification Trees.  This is because Classification Trees are most often evaluated by means of the error rate. The problem with the error rate is that it is not that helpful for assessing the descriptive capacity of the tree.
  
  For example if we look at the reduction in deviance between the Null model and the fitted tree we can say that the tree explains about XYZ% of the variation. We can also test if this is a statistically significant reduction based on a chi-squared test.
  
  Consider this example from page 310 of Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2001). The elements of statistical learning. 2nd Edition:
  
  - in a two-class problem with 400 observations in each class (denote this by (400, 400))
  - suppose one split created nodes (300, 100) and (100, 300), 
  - the other created nodes (200, 400) and (200, 0). 
  - Both splits produce a misclassification rate of 0.25, but the second split produces a pure node and is probably preferable.
  
  During the course of my research to try to identify the best available method to implement in my analysis I found a useful series of papers by Ritschard, with a worked example using SPSS.  I hope to translate that to R in the future, but the first thing I did was grab the example data used in several of those papers out of the PDF.  So seeing as this was a public dataset (I use a lot of restricted data) and because I want to be able to use it to demonstrate the use of any R functions I find or write... I thought would publish it properly.  
  
  #### The Tree Model
  So just before we leave Ritschard and the CART method, let's just fit the model.  Let's also install my R utilities package "disentangle", to test that we can access the data from it.
  
  In this analysis the civil status is the outcome (or response or decision or dependent) variable, while sex and activity sector are the predictors (or condition or independent variables). 
  
  #### Code: 
      # func
      require(rpart)
      require(partykit) 
      require(devtools)
      install_github("disentangle", "ivanhanigan")
      
      # load
      fpath <- system.file(file.path("extdata", "civst_gend_sector.csv"),
                           package = "disentangle"
                           )
      civst_gend_sector <- read.csv(fpath)
  
      # clean
      str(civst_gend_sector)
      
      # do
      fit <- rpart(civil_status ~ gender + activity_sector,
                   data = civst_gend_sector, weights = number_of_cases,
                   control=rpart.control(minsplit=1))
      # NB need minsplit to be adjusted for weights.
      summary(fit)
        
      # report
      dir.create("images")
      png("images/fit1.png", 1000, 480)
      plot(as.party(fit))
      dev.off()

#### Hadley Wickham's tidy tools
In this video at 8 mins 50 seconds he says "these four tools do 90% of the job" 

- subset, 
- transform, 
- summarise, and 
- arrange
- TODO I noticed [at the website for an Rstudio  course](http://www.rstudio.com/training/curriculum/data-manipulation.html) transform has been replaced by mutate as one of the "four basic verbs of data manipulation".

So I thought what's the other 10?  Here's a few contenders for my work:

- merge
- reshape::cast and reshape::melt
- unlist
- t() transpose
- sprintf or paste

  This post introduces a new series of blog posts in which I want to experiment with a few tools for data documentation, which I'll present as Case Studies.  This series of posts will be pitched to an audience mixture of data librarians and data analysts.
    
  Data documentation occurs in a spectrum from simple notes through to elaborate systems.  I've been working on a conceptual framework about how the actual process can be done in two distinct ways:
  
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI) solutions
  - Programmatic (Scripted/Automagic) solutions
   
  I think the GUI tools are in general pretty user friendly and useful
  for simple projects with only a small number of datasets, but have a
  major drawback for the challenge of heterogeneous data integration.  I
  think the problem is expressed nicely [In This Post By Carl Boettiger](http://carlboettiger.info/2013/06/23/notes-on-leveraging-the-ecological-markup-language.html)  in reference to Morpho:
  
  - "looks like a rather useful if tedious tool for generating EML
  files. Unfortunately, without the ability to script inputs or
  automatically detect existing data structures, we are forced through
  the rather arduous process of adding all metadata annotation each
  time...."
  - "...A package could also provide utilities to generate EML from R objects, leveraging the metadata implicit in R objects that is not present in a CSV (in which there is no built-in notion of whether  a column is numeric or character string, what missing value characters it uses, or really if it is consistent at all. Avoiding manual specification of these things makes the metadata annotation less tedious as well."
    
  # Centralised Repository, Distributed Users
  A key aspect of current approaches is the existence of a centralised data management system.  All the examples I consider include at least a metadata catalogue and some also include a data repository.  An additional feature sometimes exists for managing users permissions.
  
  The relationship between users and centralised services is a really complicated space, but essentially consists of the ability for users to create the documentation and push it (perhaps along with the data) to the metadata catalogue  and/or repository.  So given these assumptions I propose the following types of arrangement:
  
  - user sends metadata to metadata catalogue
  - user sends metadata and data to metadata catalogue and data repository 
  - user sends metadata and data and permissions information to metadata catalogue and data repository and permissions system.
    
  The Case Studies I've identified that I want to explore are listed below, names follow the format 'client tool'-and-'data repository or metadata catalogue'-and-optionally-'permissions system':

  This post is just a short note about something I'm thinking of calling "documentation-driven development".
  It is based on the concept of ["test-driven development"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and more recently:
  
  - ["test-driven analysis"](http://lamages.blogspot.in/2013/04/test-driven-analysis.html) 
  - or even ["Evidence-based Data Analysis"](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/09/05/implementing-evidence-based-data-analysis-treading-a-new-path-for-reproducible-research-part-3/)).
  - It is also a kind of a critique on the paradigm suggested by the BCCVL statement on ["Just-In-Time metadata"](http://bccvl.org.au/blog/2013/08/20/just-in-time-metadata/). 
  
  Anyway, it is a small thing but hopefully big things will grow.

title: What Do Scientists Who Write Metadata Use To Do It? And Why?
date: 2013-11-06
categories:
- Data Documentation
---


- The extent to which scientists write metadata is probably lower than it ought to be
- The level of metadata written during science projects is probably described generally as 'bare-minimum' and "the minimum needed for one-self to come back to and understand what one did"
- It sometimes seems that even the bare minimum for one-self is not being kept very often
- I argue that the reasons for less-than-adequate metadata can be understood by looking at 
- 1) the culture of the scienctists displinary background via training
- 2) the tools available and 
- 3) institutional  requirements to produce metadata (both about data or access to data)
- In my ongoing [series of blog posts I am exploring the tools available](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2013/10/two-main-types-of-data-documentation-workflow/).  
- In this post I just wanted to start the discussion about discipline culture and institutional requirements.

### Discipline Culture

- I trained in Geography in the age of GIS and this community uses metadata a lot
- Due to the prevalance of the digital map (collection of layers) which is a derivative data output
- Need to know the source of all the layers
- first law of GIS is "garbage in, garbage out" 
- I was trained in the ANSLIC standard from the start
- ArcGIS has a tool called ArcCatalog which makes metadata easy to create and view

### Institutional Requirements

- The ARC and NHMRC say they are going to require more metadata (and even data deposit)
- Restrictions on data access make it necessary to describe at least the metadata around provision agreements, licence, allowable access
- A supporting management level who value the metadata as research output (alongside a peer reviewed paper metadata pales in comparison)
- My old boss used to say "Work Not Published Is Work Not Done".

### This reminds me of Approaches and Barriers to Reproducible Research

- In 2011 BiostatMatt (Matt Shotwell) published [a survey of biostatisticians](http://biostatmatt.com/uploads/shotwell-interface-2011.pdf)
 VUMC Dept. of Biostatistics to assess:
- the prevalence of fully scripted data analyses
- the prevalence of literate programming practices

To assess the perceived barriers to reproducible research the also asked:

    What The biggest obstacle to always reproducibly scripting your work?

<p></p>


    | Barrier                                                  | Staff | Faculty |
    |----------------------------------------------------------+-------+---------|
    | No signifcant obstacles.                                 |     8 |      10 |
    | I havent learned how.                                    |     0 |       0 |
    | It takes more time.                                      |     7 |       7 |
    | It makes collaboration difficult (eg. file compatibility)|     4 |       2 |
    | The software I use doesnt facilitate reproducibility.    |     0 |       0 |
    | Its not always necessary for my work to be reproducible. |     2 |       0 |
    | Other                                                    |     2 |       1 |
    |----------------------------------------------------------+-------+---------|

### So what about the Approaches and Barriers to Me Writing Metadata?

With a sample size of one I asked myself these questions:


    | Q                                                  | A                                                                    |
    |----------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Do I fully document data (to a metadata standard?) | Occasionally, using DDI for high value raw inputs and final products |
    | Do I employ data documentation practices           | I use a tool I created to write minimal metadata occasionally        |
    | What are the main barriers?                        | takes more time, The software doesnt facilitate, not always necessary|

### Conclusions

- The tools need to help write metadata
- the Institution needs to require metadata
-

  R is generally very good for handling many different data types but
  
  ### R has problems with survey data
  
  This post is a stub about what packages Ive found with methods allowing to handle efficiently survey data: handle variable labels, values labels, and retrieve information about missing values
  
  #### Base R:
      ## Not run:
      require(foreign)
      analyte  <- read.spss(filename, to.data.frame=T) 
      varslist <- as.data.frame(attributes(analyte)$variable.labels)
      # this gives a pretty useful thing to use
  <p></p>
  
  While I was digging around in [TraMineR](http://mephisto.unige.ch/traminer) I found this link to Dataset, Emmanuel Rousseaux's package for handling, documenting and describing data sets of survey data. 
  
  #### Code:Dataset, a package for handling-survey-data-with-r
      if(!require(Dataset)) install.packages("Dataset", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org");
      require(Dataset)
      data(dds)
      str(dds)
      # cool
      description(dds$sexe)
      # excellent!
  
  <p></p>
  
  ### Conclusions
  
  I'm sure there are plenty of other approaches.  I'll add them as I find them'

Here are a few links to some recent data munging tips I picked up last week:

#### Database Relationships

1. [This is a a very quick way to look at the relationships in a database](http://pirategrunt.com/2013/12/13/24-days-of-r-day-13/)

#### MS Access field (column) descriptions:

- I'm looking for methods to access the metadata related to the columns.
- In general MS Access seems to hide these:
- http://blogannath.blogspot.com.au/2010/03/microsoft-access-tips-tricks-list-table.html
- "Field descriptions can be entered by the user when creating the table in design view. It is a highly encouraged practice since the description can provided valuable documentation about the purpose of each field in a table. The inability to extract the field descriptions as part of the table documentation using Access's built-in documenter is therefore quite inconvenient."
- I can see there is [a C# method, but I'd need visual studio or someone to compile this I suppose?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7041824/retrieve-msaccess-database-column-description)
- My mate Francis said: "you'll have to use a script that uses the Microsoft OLE-DB, as in the stackoverflow answers. However, you don't need Visual Studio or C# to do this, just any language that can interface with Windows COM objects. Python can do this, so this might be your excuse to finally learn it. I imagine there might even by a R library out there somewhere, although it would probably be more convenient to go the python route here."
- To get started with COM and python, you [could do worse than to start with](http://timgolden.me.uk/pywin32-docs/html/com/win32com/HTML/QuickStartClientCom.html)

#### Data manipulation

1. [This guy has created some custom functions that look helpful](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/three-quick-and-simple-data-cleaning.html)
1. [Revolutions Blog links to several Data Wrangling resources](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/12/tutorial-basic-data-processing-with-r.html)

#### Code editor / IDE

1. [Updates to Rstudio server are always worth checking out](http://www.r-bloggers.com/new-version-of-rstudio-v0-98/)

  #### Case Study: reml-and-rfigshare
  First we will look at the work of the ROpenSci team and the reml
  package.  In the vignette they show how to publish data to figshare
  using rfigshare package.  [figshare](http://figshare.com/) is a site
  where scientists can share datasets/figures/code. The goals are to
  encourage researchers to share negative results and make reproducible
  research efforts user-friendly. It also uses a tagging system for
  scientific research discovery. They give you unlimited public space
  and 1GB of private space.  
  
  Start by getting the reml package.
  
  #### Code:
      # func
      require(devtools)
      install_github("reml", "ropensci")
      require(reml)
      ?eml_write
  <p></p>
  This is the Top-level API function for writing eml.  Help page is a bit sparse.  See [This Link](https://github.com/ropensci/reml) for more.  For eg "for convenience, dat could simply be a data.frame and reml will launch it's metadata wizard to assist in constructing the metadata based on the data.frame provided. While this may be helpful starting out, regular users will find it faster to define the columns and units directly in the format above."
  
  
  Now load up the test data for classification trees I described in [This Post](/2013/10/test-data-for-classification-trees/)
  
  #### Code:
      install_github("disentangle", "ivanhanigan") # for the data
                                                   # described in prev post
  
      # load
      fpath <- system.file(file.path("extdata", "civst_gend_sector.csv"),
                           package = "disentangle"
                           )
      civst_gend_sector <- read.csv(fpath)
  
      # clean
      str(civst_gend_sector)
  
      # do
      eml_write(civst_gend_sector,
                creator = "Ivan Hanigan <ivanhanigan@gmail.com>")
  
  
                
  
  
      # Starts up the wizard, a section is shown below.  The wizard
      # prompts in the console and the user writes the answer.
  
      # Enter description for column 'civil_status':
      #  marriage status
      # column civil_status appears to contain categorical data.
      #  
      # Categories are divorced/widowed, married, single
      #  Please define each of the categories at the prompt
      # define 'divorced/widowed':
      # was once married
      # define 'married':
      # still married
      # define 'single':
      # never married
  
      # TODO I don't really know what activity_sector is.  I assumed
      # school because Categories are primary, secondary, tertiary.
  
      # this created "metadata.xml" and "metadata.csv"
      file.remove(c("metadata.xml","metadata.csv"))
  <p></p>  
  This was a very minimal data documentation effort.  A bit more detail would be better.  Because I would now need to re-write all that in the wizard I will take the advice of the help file that "regular users will find it faster to define the columns and units directly in the format"
  
  #### Code:
      ds <- data.set(civst_gend_sector,
                     col.defs = c("Marriage status", "sex", "education", "counts"),
                     unit.defs = list(c("was once married","still married","never married"),
                         c("women", "men"),
                         c("primary school","secondary school","tertiary school"),
                         c("persons"))
                     )
      ds
      # this prints the dataset and the metadata
      # now run the EML function
      eml_write(ds, 
                title = "civst_gend_sector",  
                description = "An example, fictional dataset for Decision Tree Models",
                creator = "Ivan Hanigan <ivanhanigan@gmail.com>",
                file = "inst/extdata/civst_gend_sector_eml.xml"
                )
      # this created the xml and csv with out asking anything
      # but returned a
      ## Warning message:
      ## In `[<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, , value = list(civil_status = c(2L,  :
      ##   Setting class(x) to NULL;   result will no longer be an S4 object
  
      # TODO investigate this?
  
      # now we can access the local EML
      obj <- eml_read("inst/extdata/civst_gend_sector_eml.xml")
      obj 
      str(dataTable(obj))
      # returns an error
      ## Error in plyr::compact(lapply(slotNames(from), function(s) if (!isEmpty(slot(from,  (from attribute.R#300) : 
      ##   subscript out of bounds
  <p></p>
  
  # Conclusions
  So this looks like a useful tool.  Next steps are to:
  
  - look at sending these data to figshare
  - describe a really really REALLY simple workflow (3 lines? create metadata, eml_write, push to figshare)

  In the last post I explored the functionality of reml.
  This time I will try to send data to figshare.
  
  - First follow [These Instructions](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare) to get rfigshare set up.  In particular store your figshare credentials in ~/.Rprofile
  
  #### Code:reml-and-rfigshare-part-2
      # func
      require(devtools)
      install_github("reml", "ropensci")
      require(reml)

      # clean
      obj
      # do
  
      ## STEP 1: find one of the preset categories
      # available. We can ask the API for
      # a list of all the categories:
      list <- fs_category_list()
      list[grep("Survey", list)]
  
      ## STEP 2: PUBLISH TO FIGSHARE
      id <- eml_publish(fname,
                        description="Example EML
                          A fictional dataset",
                        categories = "Survey results",
                        tags = "EML",
                        destination="figshare"
                        )
      # there are several warnings
      # but go to figshare and it has sent the metadata and data OK
  
      # make public using either the figshare web interface, the
      # rfigshare package (using fs_make_public(id)) or just by adding
      # the argument visibility = TRUE to the above eml_publish
      fs_make_public(id)
  
      
  <p></p>
  # Now these data are on figshare
  
  Now I have published the data they are visible and have a DOI

  In this post I use the tool produced at the ANU by the DataCommons team.  This requires Python3.
  
  # What does it do?
  The script only creates new collection records. The functionality to edit records didn’t make it into the script as the expectation is that automated ingests will only require creation of new datasets to which files will be uploaded. 
  
  Users can feel free to tweak the collection parameter file to their liking in the development environment until happy with the results.
  
  # Create the metadata.txt
  
  You need to get the python scripts and conf file from the ANU DataCommons team.  Store these somewhere handy and move to that directory.
  
  change the anudc.conf: to test out the scripts by creating some sample records, please uncomment the “host” field in the file that points to dc7-dev2.anu.edu.au:8443 , and comment out the one that points to datacommons.anu.edu.au:8443.
  
  Also you get a different token in dev and prod servers for security reasons you cannot use the same token. Also, storing your username and password in plain text is not recommended and is to be used only for debugging purposes. Also, in my case I had to change the owner group to ‘5’ when creating records in dev. In prod, it’s 6.
  
  You can look int the "Keys.txt" file that contains the full list of values that can be specified in this metadata.txt file.     
  
  #### Code:
      setwd("~/tools/dcupload")
      sink("metadata.txt")
      cat("
      # This file, referred to as a collection parameter file, consists of
      # data in key=value pairs. This data is sent to the ANU Data Commons
      # to create a collection, establish relations with other records,
      # and/or upload files to those collections.
       
      # The metadata section consists of metadata for use in creation (not
      # for modification) of record metadata in ANU Data Commons. The

  # What happened?
  
  - Looking in the metadata.txt file it now has a pid like "pid = test:3527"        
  - And we have created a new record in our account on the DataCommons server.
  
      
  # go to the website
  Now go to [the dev site](https://dc7-dev2.anu.edu.au:8443/DataCommons/) and you can continue editing the record manually in the browser.
      
  Or if we have ironed out the wrinkles you could go straight to the production server at [This Link](https://datacommons.anu.edu.au:8443/DataCommons)
  
  
  # Uploading the data
  The dataset gets sent using a Java applet in the browser while you are manually editing the record using the browser.
  
  # Notes
  
  - After the records get created, the script tries to relate the record to other records as you’ve specified in the collection parameter file in the relations section. If you’re creating a record in dev2, you cannot relate it to a record in production because that record doesn’t exist in dev2. Remember that IDs for records in dev environments have the prefix “test:” while those in production have “anudc:”.
   
  - Also, when you ran the script against production the created records were linked with the record with the ID anudc:123. I have now removed those relations. You might want to change that value in your metadata.txt file so the links are established to records that created records actually can be related to. Or for testing purposes, simply delete the entire [relations] section.

  In this Case Study I will use Morpho to compare directly with reml.
  
  # Step one: Set up morpho
  
  - Follow the instructions at the ASN SuperSite website and install Morpho 1.8 rather than latest version because it has technical issues that stop it from setting permissions.    
  - [Configure morpho](http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/index.php/data/repository-tutorial).  (I will follow the ASN SuperSite instructions as a future Case Study will be to use their KNB Metacat service).
  - Do not configure to connect to the Metacat repository, will need a password to be assigned by ASN data manager.
  
  # Step 2: Look at the REML created metadata using Morpho
  
  - Morpho offers to open existing sets for modification.
  
  #### Code: get location of my example dataset
      require(disentangle)
      fpath <- system.file(file.path("extdata", "civst_gend_sector.csv"), package="disentangle")
      fpath
      dirname(fpath)
      # [1] "/home/ivan_hanigan/Rlibs/disentangle/extdata"
  
  - Morpho > File > import = civst_gend_sector_eml.xml
  - (not the figshare_civst_gend_sector_eml.xml that was created when sending to figshare)
  - Error encountered.  could not open metadata, open empty data package.  Offered to upgrade (unable to edit > accepted)
  - unable to display data, empty data package will be shown
  - top menu > Documentation > Add/Edit ion

** morpho-and-reml-boilerplate-streamline-the-process-of-metadata-entry
*** Background
    
- The Morpho/Metacat system is great for a data repository
- Morpho also claims to be suitable for Ecologists to document their data
- But in my experience it leaves a little to be desired in ease of use for both purposes
- Specifically the speed that documentation can be entered into Morpho is slow
- This post is a first attempt to create some boilerplate code to quickly generate EML metadata using REML.

*** Speed and Rigour
As I noted in a previous post, there are [two types of data documentation workflow](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2013/10/two-main-types-of-data-documentation-workflow/).  
  
- GUI
- Programatic
  
I also think there are two types of users with different motivations and constraints:

- 1) Data Analysts
- 2) Data Librarians

*** Analysts can often trade-off completeness of documentation for speed
In my view the Analysts group of users need a tool that will very rapidly document their data and workflow steps and can live with a bit less rigour in the quality of documentation.  Obviously this is not ideal but seems an inevitable trade-off needed to enable analysts to keep up the momentum of the data processing and modelling without getting distracted by tedious (and potentially unnecessary) data documentation tasks.

*** Librarians produce gold plated documentation and can take longer to produce this
On the other hand the role of the Librarian group is to produce documentation to the best level possible (given time and resource constraints) the datasets and methodologies that lead to the creation of the datasets.  For that group Rigour will take precedence and there will be a trade-off in terms of the amount of time needed to produce the documentation.

*** An example
As an example of the two different groups, an analyst working with weather data in Australia may want to specify that their variable "temperature" is the average of the daily maxima and minima, but might not need to specify that the observations were taken inside a Stevenson Screen, or even if they are in Celsius, Farenhiet or Kelvin.  They will be very keen to start the analysis to identify any associations between weather variables and the response variable they are investigating.   The data librarian on the other hand will be more likely to need to include this information so that the users of the temperature data do not mis-interpret it.

*** Embracing Inaccuracy and Incompleteness
  
- I've been talking about this for a while got referred to this document by Ben Davies at the ANUSF
[http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Documentation-Done-Right.aspx](http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Documentation-Done-Right.aspx)
- It has this bit:
#+begin_src R :session *R* :tangle no :exports reports :eval no :padline no  
  
   
    Embracing Inaccuracy and Incompleteness 
        
    The immediate answer to what’s the right way to do documentation is
    clear: produce the least amount of documentation needed to facilitate
    the most understanding, and be very explicit about which documentation
    is to be maintained and which is to be archived (i.e., read-only and
    left to rot).
#+end_src 
 
- Roughly speaking, a full EML document produced by Morpho is a bit like a whole bunch of cruft that isnt needed and gets in the way (and is more confusing)
- Whereas a minimal version Im thinking of covers almost all the generic entries providing the "minimum amount of stuff to make it work right".
  
*** Aim
  
- This experiment aims to speed up the creation of a minimal "skeleton" of metadata to a level that both the groups above can be comfortable with AS A FIRST STEP.
- It is assumed that additional steps will then need to be taken to complete the documentation, but the automation of the first part of the process should shave off enough time to suit the purposes of both groups
- It is an imperative that the quick-start creation of the metadata does not end up costing the documentor more time later on down the track if they need to go back to many of the elements for additional editing.
  
  


*** Step 1: load a simple example dataset
I've been using a [fictitious dataset from a Statistics Methodology paper by Ritschard 2006](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2013/10/test-data-for-classification-trees/).  It will do as a first cut but when it comes to actually test this out it would be good to have something that would take a bit longer (so that the frustrations of using Morpho become very apparent).

#+begin_src R :session *R* :tangle :eval no :exports reports :padline no
  
    #### R Code:
        # func
        require(devtools)
        install_github("disentangle", "ivanhanigan")
        require(disentangle)
        # load
        fpath <- system.file(
            file.path("extdata", "civst_gend_sector_full.csv"),
            package = "disentangle"
            )
        data_set <- read.csv(fpath)
        summary(data_set)
        # store it in the current project workspace
        write.csv(data_set, "data/civst_gend_sector_full.csv", row.names = F)

*** Step 2 create a function to deliver the minimal metadata object
- the package REML will create a EML metadata document quite easily
- I will assume that a lot of the data elements are self explanatory and take column names and factor levels as the descriptions

*** Results: This loads into Morpho with some errors
- Notably unable to import the data file

![morpho-reml-boilerplate.png](/images/morpho-reml-boilerplate.png)

- Also "the saved document is not valid for some reason"

![morpho-reml-boilerplate.png](/images/morpho-reml-boilerplate.png)
*** Conclusions
- This needs testing
- A failure would be that even if it is quicker to get started if it takes a long time and is difficult to fix up it might increase the risk of misunderstandings.

  I asked my colleague [Marco Fahmi](https://twitter.com/fahmiger) to
  post this as a guest post.  It came my way as a part of an email
  exchange in which another colleague had a question regarding their task
  of recording previous work in an ecological field study:
  
      ideally in such a way that we would end up with a complete metadata
      profile of previous work carried out. I would also like to see the
      establishment of a system that could also be used by the group going
      forward to keep track of information and data produced at the
      site. I hear you have been involved with establishing the
      a metadata reporting system. How does this effort currently stand,
      is it online? I was also wondering if you would be amenable to sharing
      what you have with us with the hope that i could use this as a model
      for our own system.
  
  <p></p>
  
  #### Our colleague Sheila responded first that:
  All metadata are created using a standard template document and then transfered into a software package called [Morpho](http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp).  Metadata are then uploaded with the data to the Australian Supersite Network (ASN) Portal [http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/knb/](http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/knb/).   Any other useful documents are uploaded to the website [http://www.tern-supersites.net.au](http://www.tern-supersites.net.au) either under the specific supersite tab on the left hand menu or under the Publications - Resources for SuperSite Users tab.
  
  #### Marco says:
  Morpho is an open source piece of software designed to host all kinds of ecological data. More information about how we use it at ASN can be found here: [http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/index.php/data/repository-tutorial](http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/index.php/data/repository-tutorial)
  
  Morpho should be enough for an individual researcher to organise and describe their personal data collection. If you want to share the data with colleagues or publish them online, then you will also need Metacat. There is a worldwide Metacat server available from the link account. All you need to do is request an account and connect to it via Morpho. Alternatively you can set up your own; but then you will need your own server and tech knowhow to configure it (and maintain it).
  
  For technical reasons, we have our own server running an older version of the Metacat software. You are welcome to use it if you wish (Shiela can issue you an account to log in and upload). We are also happy to provide assistance if you want to set something a standalone server for DRO. (Like any other piece of infrastructure, someone will need to look after the server after it is set up, so that's probably a decision that will need to be considered carefully).
  
  #### My comment:
      "Morpho should be enough for an individual researcher to organise
      and describe their personal data collection"
  
  I agree, but would emphasise the _should_ and then say _but_ ...
  Ultimately I'd like to see something as easy and intuitive as iTunes for music or Endnote and Mendeley for bibliographies, but...

  - This is a quick post on Quantum GIS for spatial data visualisation
  - it is also a follow up on [this post about area concordance](http://swish-climate-impact-assessment.github.io/2013/06/test-gislibrary/)
  - Quantum GIS is getting pretty good but is still a bit tricky to make good looking maps
  - QGIS can use [remote PostGIS geodatabases on the Cloud as the backend](http://swish-climate-impact-assessment.github.io/2013/04/quantumgis-and-postgis/)
  
  #### R Code: use postgis to create area-concordance
      require(devtools)
      install_github("gisviz", "ivanhanigan")
      require(gisviz)
      require(swishdbtools)
      ch <- connect2postgres2("gislibrary")
      # make a temporary tablename, to avoid clobbering
      temp_table <- swish_temptable("gislibrary")
      temp_table <- paste("public", temp_table$table, sep = ".")
      temp_table
      # this is going to be public.foo11c7673416ea
       
      sql <- postgis_concordance(conn = ch, source_table = "abs_sla.nswsla91",
         source_zones_code = 'sla_id', target_table = "abs_sla.nswsla01",
         target_zones_code = "sla_code",
         into = temp_table, tolerance = 0.01,
         subset_target_table = "cast(sla_code as text) like '105%'", 
         eval = F) 
      cat(sql)
      dbSendQuery(ch, sql)
  
  <p></p>
  
  - now connect to PostGIS using QGIS [as described in this tute](http://swish-climate-impact-assessment.github.io/2013/04/quantumgis-and-postgis/)
  - and add the layer to the map
  - Style it how you like, I also added NSWSLA1991 over the top
  - go into the "new print composer"

  This is a great example of logistic regression,  because it is pretty simple but covers good ground.  I got it from Peter Caley;s R tutorial workbook from Charles Darwin School of Environmental Research.  
  
  It is also a tragic example of the impact weather can have on health.  
  The colder it is the more likely the shuttle is to explode. 
  
  The problem was with the failure rate (and number of) O-rings that failed (n.fail) related to the temperature (temp).   
  
  #### R Code:
      #Load the data
      #The following R code will construct the dataset

      # there were 6 o rings for each of 23 attempts
      total <- rep(6,23)
      # probability of fail
      p.fail <- n.fail/total
      # Response = resp column bind them together

Hi Ed,
Thank you for the reply!

Professor Atkinson already gave me that answer by pointing me to the technical
report of rpart that describes this:
*http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/biostat/upload/61.pdf*

However, I was also only able to reproduce the "gini" impurity, and not the
"information" one.
I hope either Professor Atkinson or some other member of the list could help
out with this.

In the meantime, I also found a bug in the code I sent to the mailing list,
bellow is the fixed code (also more organized):

# manually making the first split
obs_L <- y[x<.5]
obs_R <- y[x>.5]
n_L <- sum(x<.5)
n_R <- sum(x>.5)
n <- length(x)


calc.impurity <- function(func = gini)
{
impurity_root <- func(prop.table(table(y)))
 impurity_L <- func(prop.table(table(obs_L)))
 impurity_R <-func(prop.table(table(obs_R)))
 imp <- impurity_root - ((n_L/n)*impurity_l + (n_R/n)*impurity_R) # 0.3757
 imp*n
}

# for "gini"
require(rpart)
fit <- rpart(y~x, method = "class", parms=list(split='gini'))
fit$split[,3] # 5.384615
gini <- function(p) {sum(p*(1-p))}
calc.impurity(gini) # 5.384615 # success!


# for "information" I fail...

fit <- rpart(y~x, method = "class", parms=list(split='information'))
fit$split[,3] # why is improve here 6.84029 ?

entropy <- function(p) {
if(any(p==1)) return(0) # works for the case when y has only 0 and 1
categories...
 -sum(p*log(p))
 }
calc.impurity(entropy) # 9.247559 != 6.84029

This is implemented in SPSS code. I'll try to develop R code to do these tests.

First I'll get the data out of their paper and fit the tree in figure 1

**** One row per case or using weights?
Using the case weights like above is convenient especially when datasets are very large, but caused problems in model fitting for me (tree failed to compute a deviance when done this way but succeeded with a dataset expanded so the data.frame is transformed into one in which each row is an observation.

**** COMMENT DEPRECATED, SEE BLOG Chisquare test of deviance for Classification trees
I want to use the deviance as well as the misclassification error rate for measuring the descriptive power of the tree.  Using the tree package we can access the deviance of the fitted Classification tree.  Ripley's tree package is the only one I found to give me deviance for classification trees, the other packages only return this for regression trees.

If we look at the reduction in deviance between the Null model and the fitted tree we can say that the tree explains about XYZ% of the variation. We can also test if this is a statistically significant reduction (based on a chi-squared test), but should also comment about how much explanation this is in practical terms.

**** COMMENT cut
The attached papers suggest a method to test differences between nested trees ie testing the difference with the root node with a Chi-square statistic (equivalent of the usual method used in logistic regression).

  ## Recall that R sorts the levels of a factor in alphabetical order. Because <25 comes before 25-29, 30-39, and 40-49, it has been picked as the reference cell for age. Similarly, high is the reference cell for education because high comes before low! Finally, R picked no as the base for wantsMore.
  
  ## If you are unhappy about these choices you can (1) use relevel to change the base category, or (2) define your own indicator variables. I will use the latter approach by defining indicators for women with high education and women who want no more children:
  
  d2$noMore <- d2$desire == "Wants no more"
  d2$hiEduc <- d2$educ == "Some"

**** TODO Check This: R function to calculate for classification trees
The Ritschard (2006) paper (with SPSS code) describes a complicated method that includes Needing to retrieve for each case: 
- leaf number and
- profile number

I really want to use the deviance as well as the misclassification error rate for measuring the descriptive power of the tree.
Ripley's tree package is the only one I found to give me deviance for classification trees.

The Ritschard papers suggest nice methods to test differences between nested trees ie testing the difference with the root node with a Chi-square statistic (equivalent of the usual method used in logistic regression).

Is this method employed widely in analysing survey data?
I haven't turned up many references to Ritschard since he wrote these.

So let's start simple first.  The following code follows the simpler approach:
- Take the difference in the deviance for the models (less complex model minus more complex model)
- Take the difference in degrees of freedom for the models
- difference between less complex and more complex model follows chi-square distribution

**** COMMENT http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/sta6127/chapter15.ppt
slide 22 
Two statistics are used to test whether a model is appropriate: the Pearson chi-square statistic and the likelihood ratio (aka Deviance) statistic
slide 28
Under hypothesis that less complex (reduced) model is adequate, difference follows chi-square distribution

***** non-linear-relationships-vs-non-linear-models

- I value precise language very highly
- this is because in multi-disciplinary teams it is easy to talk using the same words and mean different things
- in recent discussion about [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlnm/index.html][Distributed Lag Non-linear Models]] I started to reflect on something that has bothered me for a While
- back in 2005 my old mate Prof Keith Dear picked me up on using the term "non-linear model" incorrectly and explained the maths...
- I kind of understood but promptly forgot and found a lot of people use the term non-linear model a bit carelessly
- Yesterday I was in a discussion about comparing non-linear relationships between different studies in a meta-analysis
- I immediatly felt uncomfortable when we started to discuss these as "non-linear models"
- so here is a quick bit of google fu (with a session at the coffee shop with Steve and Mishka) to remind me about the difference between 

***** Nonlinear Regression vs. Linear Regression

- the following comes from
- http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/library/SASNLin_os.htm
- verbatim except for my attempt at mathjax notation in latex

A regression model is called nonlinear, if the derivatives
of the model with respect to the model parameters depends on one or
more parameters. This definition is essential to distinguish nonlinear
from curvilinear regression. A regression model is not necessarily
nonlinear if the graphed regression trend is curved. A polynomial
model such as this:

***** Model 1

$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i} + \beta_{2} X_{i}^2 + \epsilon_{i}$

- appears curved when y is plotted against x. It is, however, not a nonlinear model. To see this, take derivatives of y with respect to the parameters b0, b1
- dy/db0 = 1 
- dy/db1 = x 
- dy/db2 = x^2 


- None of these derivatives depends on a model parameter, the model is linear. In contrast, consider the log-logistic model 

***** Model 2

$Y_{i} = d + (a - d)/(1 + e^{b \times log(x/g)}) + \epsilon$

- Take derivatives with respect to d, for example: 

$dy/dd = 1 - 1/(1 + e^{b \times log(x/g)})$

- The derivative involves other parameters, hence the model is nonlinear.

***** Conclusions

- It is probably best to refer to the polynomial as a "non-linear relationship" in a linear model
- reserving "non-linear model" for things like Model 2

Nonlinear Regression vs. Linear Regression

    A regression model is called nonlinear, if the derivatives of the model with respect to the model parameters depends on one or more parameters. This definition is essential to distinguish nonlinear from curvilinear regression. A regression model is not necessarily nonlinear if the graphed regression trend is curved. A polynomial model such as 

Model 1

y = b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + b3x^3 + b4z  + e 

appears curved when y is plotted against x. It is, however, not a nonlinear model. To see this, take derivatives of y with respect to the parameters b0, b1, and b2 (and 3): 
dy/db0 = 1 
dy/db1 = x 
dy/db2 = x^2 
dy/db3 = x^3 

None of these derivatives depends on a model parameter, the model is linear. In contrast, consider the log-logistic model 

Model 2

y = d + (a - d)/(1 + exp{b log(x/g)}) + e 

Take derivatives with respect to d, for example: 

dy/dd = 1 - 1/(1 + exp{b log(x/g)})

The derivative involves other parameters, hence the model is nonlinear.

<p>
A regression model is called nonlinear, if the derivatives
of the model with respect to the model parameters depends on one or
more parameters. This definition is essential to distinguish nonlinear
from curvilinear regression. A regression model is not necessarily
nonlinear if the graphed regression trend is curved. A polynomial
model such as this:

  title: sync-endnote-and-mendeley-references-using-r-xml
  date: 2013-11-20
  categories:
  - research methods
  ---
  
  #### Background
  - I use Mendeley (despite them being bought out by Elsevier, who used to sell guns)
  - My Colleagues use EndNote 
  - Need to sync, they find Endnote better for their workflow
  - I tried to export my Mendeley as XML and import to Endnote, but found many duplicates that took time to rectify 
  - (and the risk is there that the RefNo they used in the Doc will be the duplicate that I removed)
  
  #### Aims
  - test if R and the XML package can help find refs in Endnote that aren't in Mendeley
  - If so can I write those into an Mendeley import for seamless integrations
  - and what about going from Mendeley to Endnote?
  
  #### Methods
  - The R XML package seems an obvious place to start
  - before writing a function, just step thru the process
  
  #### Step 1: export XML from Mendeley and Endnote
  - In Mendeley Just select the refs in the list and then from the file menu
  - In Endnote it is also under File menu
  
  #### Step 2: R Code:
      # func
      # might need sudo apt-get install r-cran-xml?
      require(XML)
  
      # load
      dir()
      [1] "EndnoteCollection.xml"
          "MendeleyCollection.Data"
      [3] "MendeleyCollection.xml" 
      
      d1 <- xmlTreeParse("EndnoteCollection.xml", useInternal=T)
  
      # clean
      str(d1)
      # ooooh xml schmexemhel voodoo?
  
      # do
      top <- xmlRoot(d1)
      str(top)
      names(top)
      # top [[1]] # prints the whole thing
      top [[1]][[1]]
      top [[1]][[2]]
      # prints a record (1 or 2)
  
      # just messing around
      length(top[[1]])
      top [[1]][[120]]
      names(top [[1]][[120]])
      names(top [[1]][[120]][["contributors"]])
      names(top [[1]][[120]][["contributors"]][["authors"]])
      top [[1]][[120]][["contributors"]][["authors"]][[2]]
      
      i <- 110
      top [[1]][[i]]
      as.matrix(names(top [[1]][[i]]))
  
  #### OK so XML as a list.
  - I think if I do a merge of two author-date-title dataframes I can easily find the diffs

  #### Open this as spreadsheet and cross check
  - make a new column for comments
  - check off which ones were in AllDocuments and not in the Mendeley group
  - this diff was because of when I imported the Endnote XML but had not assigned these to the mendeley group
  - once have cleaned up the mendeley group export again and then check which are in mendeley but not in endnote
  
  #### First here is a note
  - about a way to speed up the checks, excluding false positives using fuzzy matching
  - my method relies on the author, date and title to be written the same in both ie initials then surname or visa verca
  - But this is not always true 
  - I previously used levenshtein string matching to identify strings that are close but not identical
  - [Try this link]( http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=tips:data-strings:levenshtein)
  - [OR this link](http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=tips:data-strings:levenshtein)
  - TODO I will share this code as a GitHub Gist later!

#### Results
- I found that XML package in R can work with the Endnote and Mendeley export Files
- I think I made a lot of bad decisions about the way I went about  doing this!
- It seemed quite difficult to get the XML stuff to make sense to me
- I;ve heard that python has better libraries for working with XML
- the levenshtein string matching code proved useful again.  I should get out of the habit of looping and start using lapply etc to speed this up.
  
#### Conclusions
- This was an interesting if frustrating experiment
- The minor issues with importing from mendeley/endnote and deduplicating using their own tools was probably not worth writing all this half-baked R code.
- But I did learn more about working with XML in R (and realised this is probably not one of R's Strengths -- or mine for that matter!)

  title: Setting Up A Workflow Script With Code Chunks
  date: 2013-11-25
  categories:
  - research methods
  ---
  
  This post describes some ideas and techniques I use to set up a "workflow script".  I use this term to refer to the structured combination of code, data and narrative that make an executable Reproducible Research Report (RRR).
  
  A lot of these ideas are inpsired by  a great paper by Kieran Healy called  "Choosing Your Workflow Applications" available at [https://github.com/kjhealy/workflow-paper](https://github.com/kjhealy/workflow-paper) to accompany [his Emacs Starter Kit](http://kieranhealyo.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit.html). My shortened version of his main points are:
  
  - 1 use a good code editor
  - 2 analyse data with scripts
  - 3 store your work simply and document it properly
  - 4 use a version control system
  - 5 Automate back ups 
  - 6 Avoid distracting gadgets
  
  #### Here's my current approach in each of these categories
  - 1 use Emacs with Orgmode (and kjhealy's drop-in set of useful defaults)
  - 2 Scripts that utilise the literate programming technique of mixing Code Chunks in with descriptive prose
  - 3 John Myles White's ProjectTemplate R Package and Josh Riech's LCFD paradigm 
  - 4 git and GitHub for version control
  
  5 Automated Backups and 6 Avoiding Gadgets are still somethings I find challenging
  
  #### 1 Use a good code editor
  I like using Emacs with Orgmode.
  
  - I have previously tried a variety of code editors from Tinn-r, NppToR, Rstudio and Eclipse.  
  - Emacs with Orgmode suits me the most because it has a great number of features especially the linkage with LaTeX or HTML export
  - A key reference to look at for reasons why Emacs is so good for scientific work is Eric Schulte et al ["A Multi-Language Computing Environment for Literate Programming"](www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i03‎) 
  - Here is a [link to a great orgmode description](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html)
  - (this guy spends a lot of time on tweaking his set up)
  
  #### 2 Analyse data with Scripts (stitch together code chunks)
  I use Scripts but prefer to think of them as stitched together Code Chunks with prose into Compendia.
  
  - Compendia are documents that weave together Code and Prose into an executable report
  - The underlying philosophy is called Reproducible Research Reports
  - A very useful tool is a keyboard shortcut to quickly create a chunk for code
  - so you can be writing parts of the report like this: "Blah Blah Blah as shown in Figure X and Table Y"
  - then just hit the correct keys and WHAMM-O there is a new chunk ready for the code that creates Figure X and Table Y to be written.
  - Here is how I use Emacs to achieve this (the other editors I mentioned above also have the abiltiy to do this too).  The IPython Notebook does this stuff too but calls chunks "cells" for some reason.
  
  #### Emacs Code: Put this into the ~/.emacs.d/init.el file
      (define-skeleton chunk-skeleton
        "Info for a code chunk."
        "Title: "
        "*** " str "-code\n"
        "#+name:" str "\n"
        "#+begin_src R :session *R* :tangle src/" str ".r :exports reports :eval no\n"
        "#### name:" str " ####\n"
        "\n"
        "#+end_src\n"
      )
      (global-set-key [?\C-x ?\C-\\] 'chunk-skeleton)
  
  #### Using the Emacs Shortcut
  - now whenever you type Control-x control-\ a new code chunk will appear
  - you'll be typing "blah blah blah" and think I need a figure or table, just hit it.
  - move into the empty section and add some code
  - you can hit C-c ' to enter a org-babel code execution session that will be able to send these line by line to an R session
  - or within the main org buffer if your eval flag is set to yes then you can run the entire chunk (and return tabular output to the doc) using C-c C-c
  - To export the code chunks and create the modular code scripts without the narrative prose use C-c C-v t
  - this is called "tangling" and the chunks will be written out to the file specified in the chunk header ":tangle" flag
  
  #### Compiling the resulting Compendium
  - Emacs uses LaTeX or HTML to produce the Report
  - I find both of these outputs very pleasing
  - to compile to TEX use C-c C-e d
  - for HTML use C-c C-e h (FOR CODE HIGHLIGHTING INSTALL htmlize.el)
  - these commands will also evaluate all the chunks where ":eval" = yes to load the data and calculate the results fresh. 
  - AWESOME!
      
  #### 3 Store your work simply and document it properly
  - I use the [ProjectTemplate R package](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2010/08/26/projecttemplate/) to organise my code sections into modules
  - These modules are organised into the Reichian LCFD paradigm described first [on StackOverflow here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1434424), and encoded into [the makeProject R package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/makeProject/makeProject.pdf)
  - documentation is within the main orgmode script
  - data documentation is a whole other universe that I will deal with in a separate post
  
  #### 4 use a version control system using git and github
      # once you have the project via R
      R
      require(ProjectTemplate)
      create.project("AwesomeProject", minimal = T)
      q()
      # use the shell to start a git repo
      cd AwesomeProject
      git init
      # and commit the TODO
      git add TODO
      git commit -m "first commit"
      # tada!
  
  - Emacs can now be used to manage the git repo using the C-x g command
  - Rstudio has a really nice GUI for doing this inside it;s Project management interface too.
  
  #### Using Github or another Git Server
  - You can easily set up a Github repo for this now but it will be public
  - Alternatative is to set up your own private Git server.  I followed [these instructions to Running a Simple Git Server Using SSH](http://blog.goosoftware.co.uk/2012/02/07/quick-git-server/)
  - Either way once you have set up your remote git repo you need to set the remote tracking
  
  #### Git Code:
      cd /path/to/local/git/repo
      git remote add origin git@github-or-other-server:myname/myproject.git
      git push origin master
  
  #### 5 Automate back ups AND 6 Avoid distracting gadgets
  - OMG backups stress me out
  - ideally I would follow [this advice because "when it comes to losing your data the universe tends toward maximum irony. Don't push it."](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/09/psa-backups/)
  - But I don;t fully comply
  - Instead I generally use Dropbox for  basic project management admin stuff
  - I use github for code projects I am happy to share, I also pay for 10 private repos 
  - I Set up a git server at my workplace for extra projects but this is on a test server that is not backed up, and I am not really happy about this
  - In terms of Distracting Gadgets, I think that with the current tempo of new innovations related to new software tools for this type of work I should keep trying new things but I have pretty much settled into a comfortable zone with the gadgets I described here. 
  
  #### Conclusions
  - This is how I've worked for a couple of years
  - I find it very enjoyable, mostly productive but prone to the distractions of "distractions by gadgets"
  - The main thing I want to point out is the usage of Code Chunks in RRR scripts.
  - These things are awesome.

  - Back in 2009 Joseph Guillaume worked with me on a complicated workflow
  - He came up with this python script to help keep track of the steps
  - The simple text file is a list of transformations, inputs and output
  - It is converted to the right format and graphviz creates a html page with pop-outs

  - keep this in your work directory and update it whenever you add a step to the workflow
  - the list can be as big as you like (hundreds of steps), and entered in any order, the inputs/output relationships determine how the graph looks at the end
  - to run the script just do the one line

  #### Python code: run
      python transformations.py workflow_steps.txt index
  
  <p></p>
  - open the html page and click on a square box to bring up the pop-out
  - short text is shown, long text is replaced by an ellipse and only shown in pop-out
  
  #### Conclusions  
  - I've popped the script up as a [Github repo](https://github.com/ivanhanigan/transformations)
  - The example is in the [gh-pages branch](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/transformations/)

- Git is a Distributed Version Control System.
- The [centerforopenscience.org](centerforopenscience.org) has developed the Open Science Framework  which is they say "a simplified front end to the powerful and popular version control system Git".
- I use Github a lot for extending the local features into an online space
- So I finally got around to poking the open science framework with the [Hutchinson Drought Index project](https://openscienceframework.org/project/pyts3/)
- It turns out to be too simplified, and not have very many of the feature I love about Git and GitHub :-(
- For eg it is not really distributed in that you don't get to sync your local repo with the onlin version
- you upload a script or dataset, then you continue editing locally until you want to commit and then you have to upload again, one file at a time with the GUI rather than "git add ." and "git push".
- I recommend having a look, it might work for you, but if you want more power checkout Yihui's suggestions for using github [http://yihui.name/en/2011/12/how-to-become-an-efficient-and-collaborative-r-programmer/](http://yihui.name/en/2011/12/how-to-become-an-efficient-and-collaborative-r-programmer/)
- and [http://yihui.name/en/2013/06/fix-typo-in-documentation/](http://yihui.name/en/2013/06/fix-typo-in-documentation/)

#### In general I don't think simple front-end's should be a barrier to accessing a sophisticated back-end!

- I just got introduced to bitbucket, an alternative to Github
- I've used Github for a couple of years and have been paying for extra private repositories 
- I did not realise that bitbucket worked with git too (I thought it was just for Mercurial)
- it offers unlimited public and private repository and unlimited users (to collaborate) if you have the Academic plan.
- when you sign up with your academic email address, [you automatically get an unlimited academic plan]( http://blog.bitbucket.org/2011/04/01/free-unlimited-user-source-code-hosting-for-university-students/)

  - I really like the idea of using github or bitbucket for a dual code repository and project website
  - in Github I set up the master branch with the R package code
  - and set up the website using the gh-pages branch 
  - it has to be called gh-pages, and add an index.html, it will appear at your-username.github.com/repo-name
  
  #### Github

  - The best bit about doing this on github is that the R package "devtools" can be used to install the package (so long as you can compile the package)
  - on windows you may need to install Rtools and configure the path

  #### R Code: install_github
      require(devtools)
      install_github("repo-name", "github-account-name")

  #### Bitbucket

  - I recently took these notes about setting up a website on Bitbucket
  - I am not sure about how this would work for R packages (the devtools installer mentioned above is a great tool for developing)
  - but with unlimited private repositories this seems like a good platform for my "open notebook - selected content" (I need to be selective about what I share and what I keep restricted access only)  
  - the page is available for "your-account".bitbucket.org
  - create a new repo on the web UI 
  - I kept the repo private, but the pages will be public,
  - added issue tracking and Wiki
  
  #### using git shell
      mkdir ~/projects/your-account.bitbucket.org
      cd ~/projects/your-account.bitbucket.org
      git init
      git remote add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.org/your-account/your-account.bitbucket.org.git
      touch index.org
      # use emacs to make changes and publish the html (C-c C-e h)
       
      git commit -m "First commit"
      git push -u origin master
  
  - now it is online at http://your-account.bitbucket.org/

  - I got this header for a nice looking report from Bull, G. (2011). Example Sweave Document. SharpStatistics.co.uk.
  - This has a bunch of useful parameters, but I just really like the header and footer on pages 2 onward
  - The original was a Sweave file.  I really like Sweave but orgmode allows other languages as well as R to be inter-woven into the script
  - An alternative to Sweave is knitr and is still on my todo list, but this works well at the moment
  - I also like how you can quickly change this to a Beamer presentation style.
  - Once this is in your file use C-c C-e d to export and compile the PDF
  - This example is available at [this link](/pdfs/SharpReportTemplate.pdf)

      This is a sharp looking report template I got from an R blogger \cite{Bull2011}.
      
      The pages after the first page have a nice looking header, footer and page number.
      \clearpage
      
      ,* Section 1
      In the Org file you can see some hidden R code that computes a linear regression and returns the results shown in Table \ref{ATable}.

  - I appreciate all the arguments for using OA journals
  - Using a LaTeX template is also attractive
  - This post is a record of some experiences with the BioMedCentral (BMC) template and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) templates
  - implemented with my favourite editor for everything Emacs Orgmode.
  
  #### BMC seemed like a good option
  
  - I started this journey 6 months ago with the BMC template
  - because I pitch my work mostly at the health science community BMC seemed logical
  - It turns out I downloaded their old LaTeX template and it SUCKED
  - If you Download [the template and bibliography stuff](http://www.biomedcentral.com/authors/tex) now it looks better
  - But I am suspicious now because of the last little while I've been struggling so I've got a skeptical approach
  - First copy the stuff to a test dir
  - then use TexWorks to test compiling it
  - try deleting the provided BBL file, this reveales that the BIB file has to be compiled with bibtex to work
  - orgmode produces BBL files when evaluated but I don't know if it'll be smooth with the template
  
  #### PLOS seems like a smoother option
  
  - Download from [the LaTeX template site](http://www.plosone.org/static/latexGuidelines)
  - First thing I notice is there is no BIB file, Yay!
  - just make sure  bibliographystyle and bibliography are set
  - Looks like it isn't trying so hard

  Then the instruction tj3 testtj3.tjp generate the gant chart accessible

  - Gantt Charts are a method used in Project Management to visualise the task list and progress with a calendar.
  - The title of this post comes from [Dr Tomas Aragon's paper 'Project Management for Health Professionals'](http://berkeley.academia.edu/TomasAragon/Teaching/31679/Project_Management_for_Health_Professionals)
  - There is also an accompanying [Tutorial](http://medepi.com/2012/02/05/project-mgmt/)
  - Dr Aragon also has a couple of suggestions for software to use for creating Gantt Charts [on this page](http://medepi.com/2011/11/29/software-recs/)
  - I haven't used those but here are some I have used
  
  #### Gantter
  
  - This is an online tool, that can integrate with Google Drive [http://www.gantter.com/](http://www.gantter.com/)
  - It also imports MS Project files
  
  #### Taskjuggler
  
  - Emacs orgmode can be used with a Ruby package called Taskjuggler (tj3)
  - The command C-c C-e j will export a file such as this description ready for conversion [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.html](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.html)
  - I also needed to include this suggested by d.tchin 29 Feb 2012,  [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/52844](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/52844)
  - an example I use for a template is in my [disentangle Github repo](https://raw.github.com/ivanhanigan/disentangle/gh-pages/gantt-tj3/gantt-tj3.org)
  - which produces [this output](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/disentangle/gantt-tj3/Gantt%20Chart.html)

  - For a three year project on Bushfire smoke and Health we used the following structure in a wiki
  
  #### Sections:
      A.Background        
      B.Proposals         
      C.Approvals         
      D.Budget    
      E.Datasets  
      F.Analysis  
      G.Literature        
      H.Communication     
      I.Correspondance    
      J.Meetings  
      K.Completion        
      ContactDetails      
      README
      TODO        
  
  #### Conclusion
  - it worked quite well in the first year.
  - we didn't use it much after that.
  - it is still on the ANU webserver.  I sometimes refer back to it now, a couple of years later.

  - When we started planning for a three year project on bushfire smoke we did some planning
  - We had a deep discussion about this research management protocol from [University Manitoba Centre for Health Policy](http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/medicine/units/community_health_sciences/departmental_units/mchp/protocol/media/manage_guidelines.pdf)

  - Last week I started a new discussion about sharing and extending research protocols.
  
  #### My Colleague sent me a link to the [Prometheus Wiki](http://prometheuswiki.publish.csiro.au/tiki-custom_home.php)​
      a site for sharing research protocols. The idea is to give people
      a place to post research protocols since everyone develops them
      and then mentions them in papers but they rarely make it online in
      a usable format. We see this as a big bottleneck in the rate of
      knowledge discovery. Since users will always want to change and
      adapt a given protocol for changing applications or new technology
      or just to improve it. This sort of thing is done with open source
      all the time (i.e. git) but how you'd do it with an online
      protocol based out of a wiki is unknown. The current version of
      the website is not very flexible and doesn't really enable the
      sort of dynamic collaboration that I envision would make this a
      really useful tool. Git seems like an obvious conceptual starting
      point but there'd need to be a front end markup system in place
      that was integrated with that git-type backend. Since you've
      mentioned git a few times and the open science project, I thought
      you might find this interesting to think about. any suggestions or
      inspirations would be welcomed

  #### My past experience
  
  - I have previously tried to use a wiki for the development of new sections in an existing study protocol on estimating the effects of bushfire smoke air pollution and human health.
  - We combined elements of two major air pollution/health study protocols (one from Europe, one from America) with local considerations and decisions made within our team.
  - On reflection all this was mostly useful for me, to a lesser extent the other programmer and I don't think the project manager or statistician ever even looked at any of this.
  
  #### Jeff Leek's current approach using GitHub
  
  I have been keeping an eye on the work by Jeff Leek on putting protocols onto Github and inviting collaboration to edit and extend them [as he says](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/07/the-leek-group-policy-for-developing-sustainable-r-packages/):
  
      I put it on Github because I'm still not 100% sure I got it
      right... I would welcome feedback/pull requests on how we can
      improve the policy to make it better

  #### Leek Group policies and protocols on github so far
  
  - [https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages) accompanied by [this post](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/07/the-leek-group-policy-for-developing-sustainable-r-packages/)
  - [https://github.com/jtleek/reviews](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews) accompanied by [this post](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/23/the-leek-group-guide-to-reviewing-scientific-papers/)
  - [https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) accompanied by [this post](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/11/14/the-leek-group-guide-to-sharing-data-with-a-statistician-to-speed-collaboration/)
  
  #### I forked "datasharing" for my own. Renamed: "How to share data to avoid misunderstanding"
  
  - I liked the datasharing policy so much [I forked it for my own collaborations](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/datasharing/).
  - I initially just made a minor recommendation to one of the lines in the original using the great Github feature that if you edit a repo you don't have access to, it forks the repo and creates a feature branch behind the scenes. After you submit the changes (which is a commit) it puts you right into the pull request form.
  - Therefore it can all be done on the GitHub site. I submitted [the pull request without leaving my web browser](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing/pull/11).
  - But then I thought I would have done things a bit differently.  In particular I'd like a webpage with a table of contents, and a nicer looking landing page.
  - so I cloned my fork of the repo, then created a new branch called gh-pages, then copied the original to a new file called index.org, added some Emacs Orgmode HTML export magic and then "C-c C-e h" and WHAMM-O I've got my own version for extending with at [http://ivanhanigan.github.io/datasharing/](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/datasharing/).
  
  #### The code version:
      git clone git@github.com:ivanhanigan/datasharing.git ~/tools/datasharing
      cd ~/tools/datasharing
      git checkout -b gh-pages
      mv README.md index.org
      touch README.md
      # edits to index.org, "C-c C-e h" and WHAMM-O
      git add index.org index.html README.md
      git push origin gh-pages
  
  <p></p>
  
  - In this way I think people can share and collaborate easily [(if they know git)](http://yihui.name/en/2013/06/fix-typo-in-documentation/)
  - as well as easily take work started by someone else and extend it for their own work.
  - I wonder a little bit about how much of my extensions I should offer back to Jeff Leek as the original author.
  - I guess he can always track what I do to it via the link back to his original shown in [https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing/network](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing/network)
  
  #### PS Jeff Leek uses github a lot!
  As he says in [this post from the future-of-statistics unconference](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/11/21/future-of-statistics-take-home-messages-futureofstats/):
  
      You can read it on Github here (https://github.com/jtleek/futureofstats).
      I put it on Github for two reasons:
       
      - I agree with Hadley's statement that the future of statistics is on Github.
      - I summarized them based on my interpretation and would love
        collaboration on the document. If you want to add your new
        thoughts/summaries, add a new section with your bullet pointed
        ideas and send me a pull request!
  <p></p>
  #### Conclusions
  
  - Jeff Leek is on to something really interesting with these github policies and protocols
  - I find the look of his plain markdown README.md pages a bit un-inspiring
  - but then I spend too much of my time tweaking my html by far (while Jeff is getting on with the real work of publishing papers)
