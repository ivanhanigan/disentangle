 This is the workflow diagram for the health forecasting project at NCEPH \cite{Dear2010} which can be viewed
 \href{[[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7075452/HF_data/data_transformations.html}{at][http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7075452/HF\_data/data\_transformations.html}{at]] this link}.
 The relationship between daily air quality and daily hospital admissions is being examined:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Three cities, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney
 \item Daily for seven years, 1998 - 2004 (2,557 days)
 \item Twelve disease clusters; both emergency admissions and all admissions; though for most analyses only emergency admissions were considered
 \item By age and sex  (twelve groups)
 \item By spatial subunits of each city: statistical local area (SLA) for Melbourne and Sydney and, for Brisbane, larger zones (clusters of SLAs) designed specifically for this project.
 \end{itemize}
 In all there were 0.76 million emergency admissions in Brisbane, 1.66m in Melbourne, and 2.54m in Sydney.
